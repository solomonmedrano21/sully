        Who is James P. Sullivan??!
        <p>
          James Patrick Sullivan (better known as Sulley) is the protagonist of
          the 2001 Disneyâ€¢Pixar animated film Monsters, Inc. and the
          deuteragonist of its 2013 prequel. He was a renowned scarer at
          Monsters, Inc. where he works alongside his partner and best friend
          Mike Wazowski. Sulley's world gets turned upside down when he becomes
          the accidental guardian of a human child (whom he dubs "Boo"). In
          working to return Boo to the human world, Sulley manages to uncover a
          company conspiracy while also solving an energy crisis that plagued
          the city of Monstropolis.

      <h3>Good side</h3>
      <p>humble and caring. Although highly competitive and concerned with his status at Monsters, Inc., Sulley is extremely modest. And in spite of his utmost devotion, his moral standards remain more important to him than anything; he is willing to sacrifice his personal gains for what he feels is right.</p>
